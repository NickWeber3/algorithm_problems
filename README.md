Any problem where a data structure is initially given (e.g. merge two arrays, rotate a linked list, etc.) has been put in that particular data structure's directory.

All other problems, including those with data structures that YOU should come up with, are in the "Algorithm and Complexity" directory.

Keep the grind alive.
